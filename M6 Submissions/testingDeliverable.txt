  testBossSpawn()
     This test was made to ensure that the correct amount of bosses are spawned per wave. Bosses are initialized
     without an image using a default constructor to prevent un-initalized graphics errors. A wave of bosses should be
     instantiated with arbitrary position properties

  checkStartingTowerAttributes()
     This test ensures that towers are spawned with the correct range and damage. This test was included in this
     milestone because a test for these values would be redundant in prior milestones. Now, with the inclusion of
     tower upgrades, the test serves to regulate the base case of the towers.

testBossHealthGreaterThanEnemy()
	This test was created to ensure that the boss is harder to kill given it should have a higher health than a regular enemy.

testMoneyEarnedinGame()
	This test was created to check if money increases once the game has gone into combat. Money should not increase if the game has not gone into combat.
