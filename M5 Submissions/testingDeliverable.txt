    For the actual game run time, we included the following tests:
 - a test to check if proper projectile amounts are spawned
 - a test to see if waves are spawned correctly

  testWaveSpawn()
     This test was made to ensure that the correct amount of enemies are spawned per wave. Enemies are initialized
     without an image using a default constructor to prevent un-initalized graphics errors. A wave of enemies should be
     instantiated with arbitrary position properties

  testProjectileSpawn()
     This test ensures that projectiles are spawned correctly for each tower shot. An arbitrary integer is passed in
     and the check ensures that a correct number of projectiles are initialized and added to an active array. This functions
     similarly to the testWaveSpawn() test, however checks for the projectile object rather than an enemy object.

  checkProjectileCollison()
     The purpose of this test is to ensure the projectile/enemy collision detection system functions correctly.

  checkEnemyHealthUponCollision()
     This test verifies that enemies take damage correctly when the game detects a collision with a projectile.

  testRangeChecker()
     This test serves to check the range checker, to ensure that it works correctly. With a few inputs, we can ensure
     that it returns true when an enemy is in range of a tower, and false when the enemy is not.
